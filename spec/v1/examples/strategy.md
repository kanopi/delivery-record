## What changed

Produced the platform recommendation comparing monolithic Drupal, headless
Drupal, and a hybrid approach, with a clear recommendation and rationale.

## What the AI produced

`strategic-thinking` worked through the 5 Cs and produced the trade-off matrix
and the cost/consequence analysis for each option.

## What the human verified

Checkpoint 1 (plan approval): @grace confirmed the three options were the right
ones to evaluate.
Checkpoint 2 (final approval): @grace verified each recommendation cites a real
constraint and that the editorial-complexity risk from the prior headless attempt
is reflected; @account confirmed the recommendation fits the budget envelope.

## Issues found and resolved

- Removed an over-stated performance claim about headless that lacked a source.

## Deferred or known risks

- Editorial workflow requirements still undefined; recommendation is conditional
  on documenting them first (owner @grace, PROJ-611).
