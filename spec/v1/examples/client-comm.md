## What changed

Drafted the Sprint 4 client status update for the Teamwork message thread:
completed work, in-progress items, and the upcoming milestone.

## What the AI produced

`project-heartbeat` pulled the closed tasks, recent Teamwork messages, and the
latest meeting summary into a warm, progress-forward draft.

## What the human verified

Checkpoint 1 (plan approval): @dana confirmed the update should focus on the
milestone delivery date.
Checkpoint 2 (final approval): @dana verified every status claim against the
actual ticket states and confirmed no new scope, timeline, or budget commitment
was implied; @account approved the tone before posting.

## Issues found and resolved

- Draft implied a firm launch date; softened to "on track for end of month".

## Deferred or known risks

- None.
