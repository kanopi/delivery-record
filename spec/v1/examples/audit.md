## What changed

Full WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility audit of the marketing site: 12 representative
pages across 7 templates, 41 findings ranked by the four-level severity rubric.

## What the AI produced

`accessibility-audit` spawned the accessibility-specialist, which captured the
axe automated pass and the keyboard/screen-reader manual review, then produced
the ranked findings report.

## What the human verified

Checkpoint 1 (plan approval): @frank confirmed the page sample covered every
distinct template before the audit ran.
Checkpoint 2 (final approval): @eve manually re-confirmed all 7 critical findings
in a screen reader and removed 3 axe false positives before the report shipped.

## Issues found and resolved

- 3 automated false positives (decorative SVGs flagged as missing alt) removed.

## Deferred or known risks

- Third-party embedded map widget is non-conformant; vendor ticket filed
  (owner @frank, PROJ-318).
