## What changed

Synthesized the discovery research into three primary audience segments with
supporting evidence from interviews, the survey, and analytics.

## What the AI produced

Drafted the segment definitions, journey hypotheses, and the evidence map linking
each claim back to a cited source.

## What the human verified

Checkpoint 1 (plan approval): @grace confirmed the synthesis framework before
drafting.
Checkpoint 2 (final approval): @grace verified every segment claim traces to a
cited source and that the survey's self-selection bias is called out; @dana
confirmed the segments align with the engagement goals.

## Issues found and resolved

- One unsupported claim about mobile usage removed pending analytics confirmation.

## Deferred or known risks

- Survey skewed toward existing members; net-new audience under-sampled
  (owner @grace, PROJ-409).
