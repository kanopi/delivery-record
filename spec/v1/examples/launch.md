## What changed

Launch readiness record for the example.com relaunch: the pre-launch audit
results, the DNS/SSL cutover plan, and the rollback procedure, consolidated for
go-live sign-off.

## What the AI produced

`performance-analyzer` confirmed Core Web Vitals against the launch budget;
`structured-data-analyzer` validated the JSON-LD on the key templates. Both
reports are linked from the launch notebook.

## What the human verified

Checkpoint 1 (plan approval): @dana confirmed the cutover window and the
stakeholder list.
Checkpoint 2 (final approval): @techlead verified the rollback plan was tested
against a staging snapshot and that the redirect map covered every legacy URL;
@client approved go-live.

## Issues found and resolved

- Two legacy URLs were missing from the redirect map; added before sign-off.

## Deferred or known risks

- Third-party review widget loads async; monitored for the first 48 hours (owner
  @dana, PROJ-901).
