## What changed

Production deploy of release v2.4.0: the breadcrumb component, two bug fixes, and
a config change for the new content type. Release notes generated from the merged
PR titles since v2.3.0.

## What the AI produced

`commit-message-generator` assembled the release notes from the conventional-commit
history. The deploy command was posted for a human to run — the skill does not
deploy on its own.

## What the human verified

Checkpoint 1 (plan approval): @sam confirmed the release scope and the backup step
ran before cutover.
Checkpoint 2 (final approval): @techlead verified the config import and database
updates applied cleanly, then ran the smoke test across the three critical paths.

## Issues found and resolved

- Config import warned about a stale block placement; re-exported and re-ran clean.

## Deferred or known risks

- None.
