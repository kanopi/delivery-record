## What changed

Compiled the homepage redesign handoff: goals and KPIs, audience mapping, two
user journeys, and the Dev Mode-ready Figma references for the engineering team.

## What the AI produced

`design-analyzer` extracted the component inventory, spacing tokens, and
breakpoint specs from the Figma file into the handoff document.

## What the human verified

Checkpoint 1 (plan approval): @heidi confirmed the handoff template matched the
project's design system.
Checkpoint 2 (final approval): @ivan verified each Figma frame is published and
linked, the KPIs are measurable, and both journeys map to real templates;
@heidi signed off on creative fidelity.

## Issues found and resolved

- Mobile hero spacing token was ambiguous; pinned to the 8px scale.

## Deferred or known risks

- Animation spec for the hero is described in prose only; motion handoff to follow
  (owner @ivan, PROJ-507).
