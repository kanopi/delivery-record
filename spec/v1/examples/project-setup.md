## What changed

Established the shared project context: a `CLAUDE.md` documenting the stack,
DDEV/Composer commands, and coding standards, plus an onboarding brief pointing
to the SOW, hosting, and Teamwork.

## What the AI produced

`documentation-generator` drafted `CLAUDE.md` from an inspection of the repo
(composer.json, theme tooling, CI config) and the SOW, then flagged commands it
could not verify.

## What the human verified

Checkpoint 1 (plan approval): @dana confirmed the sections to include and the
source documents.
Checkpoint 2 (final approval): @techlead ran every documented command against a
fresh checkout to confirm accuracy; @pm approved the onboarding brief and
confirmed access to hosting, Teamwork, and Drive.

## Issues found and resolved

- Draft listed a `npm run test` script that does not exist; removed after the
  command-verification pass.

## Deferred or known risks

- None.
