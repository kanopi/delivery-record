## What changed

Enables the Redis object cache for the project: adds the DDEV service, the
CircleCI config, and the Pantheon settings wiring. No application code paths
change.

- `.ddev/docker-compose.redis.yaml`
- `.circleci/config.yml`
- `web/sites/default/settings.pantheon.php`

## What the AI produced

`code-standards-checker` linted the settings changes. The Terminus commands to
enable the Pantheon Redis add-on were printed for a human to run — the skill does
not touch the hosting account directly.

## What the human verified

Checkpoint 1 (plan approval): @sam confirmed the cache backend choice and the
lower-environment test plan.
Checkpoint 2 (final approval): @devops-lead verified no secrets landed in the repo,
confirmed the cache hit on the multidev, and tested the revert path.

## Issues found and resolved

- Initial config committed a placeholder auth token; removed and moved to an env var.

## Deferred or known risks

- None.
