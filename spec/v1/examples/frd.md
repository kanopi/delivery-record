## What changed

Drafted the full FRD for the Member Portal milestone: 10 sections, 38 functional
requirements (FR-001–FR-038), 12 technical requirements, and 24 user stories.

## What the AI produced

`frd-generator` produced the section scaffold and requirement numbering;
`story-point-estimator` produced the per-story Fibonacci estimates and the hour
conversion; `csv-exporter` produced the Teamwork backlog CSV.

## What the human verified

Checkpoint 1 (plan approval): @carol confirmed the requirement decomposition
matched the SOW scope before estimation.
Checkpoint 2 (final approval): @carol verified the 412h total against the 480h
SOW cap and spot-checked five high-point stories; @dana confirmed every SOW line
item maps to at least one requirement and flagged the SSO integration as a
phase-2 out-of-scope note.

## Issues found and resolved

- Two duplicate requirements (search + filter) merged into FR-019.

## Deferred or known risks

- SSO integration deferred to phase 2 (owner @dana, PROJ-241).
