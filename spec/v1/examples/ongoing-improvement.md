## What changed

Quarterly site-health review for example.com: Core Web Vitals trend, error-rate
and uptime summary, and a prioritized list of improvement recommendations for the
next engagement block.

## What the AI produced

`performance-analyzer` pulled the CWV trend across the top templates;
`coverage-analyzer` flagged three untested code paths that recur in error logs.
Findings were compiled into a ranked recommendation list.

## What the human verified

Checkpoint 1 (plan approval): @dana confirmed the metrics window and the templates
to sample.
Checkpoint 2 (final approval): @techlead reproduced the top three findings and
confirmed the effort estimates were realistic; @pm approved the priority order.

## Issues found and resolved

- One "regression" was a measurement artifact from a synthetic-test change; dropped
  from the findings after verification.

## Deferred or known risks

- INP on the search results template is borderline; scheduled for the next block
  (owner @techlead, PROJ-771).
