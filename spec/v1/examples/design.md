## What changed

Hi-fidelity homepage comps built on the approved design system: hero, feature
grid, testimonial band, and footer. Delivered as a Figma file with named layers
and component instances.

## What the AI produced

`design-analyzer` extracted the token set (colors, type scale, spacing) from the
existing design system and flagged three spots where the draft diverged from the
brand palette.

## What the human verified

Checkpoint 1 (plan approval): @dana confirmed the layout direction against the
content strategy before building comps.
Checkpoint 2 (final approval): @creative-director verified brand alignment,
component reuse, and AA contrast on every text-over-image treatment; @client
approved the direction.

## Issues found and resolved

- Testimonial text over the photo failed AA; added a scrim to reach 4.6:1.

## Deferred or known risks

- None.
