# Delivery Record

Draft a schema-typed, human-signed Delivery Record — one markdown file per
significant AI-assisted output — then write it and index it in Teamwork. The
main session runs this skill directly; no orchestrator agent is involved.

The record proves a piece of AI-assisted work was reviewed by a **named human**
and ran through Kanopi's workflow. The schema is canonical in this repo at
[`spec/v1/`](../../spec/v1/README.md).

## ⚠️ Side Effect Warning

**This skill writes a file and posts to Teamwork.** Specifically it:

- Writes a markdown file to `docs/delivery-records/` in the repo (code) or to the
  client's Drive (non-code).
- Posts an index comment on the project's "Delivery Records" Teamwork notebook
  (and, with your confirmation, creates that notebook if it is missing).
- For code records, amends the open PR description with a link to the record.

**The human checkpoint is mandatory.** This skill **refuses to write the file**
without a named reviewer and both checkpoint notes (see step 4).

## When a record is required

Required whenever the output is **client-facing** (code that ships, a deliverable
sent to the client, a message on a client thread) **or load-bearing internal** (an
FRD, IA, audit, architecture decision, or design-to-dev handoff that downstream
work depends on).

**Not** required for ephemeral chat, meeting prep, status notes, throwaway spikes,
or brainstorming.

## Usage

- "Create a delivery record for this PR"
- "Generate a delivery record for the audit report"
- `/delivery-record [--activity-type <type>] [--pr <n>] [--ticket <key>] [--scope <scope>] [--reviewer <handle>]`

### Inputs (CLI-style flags accepted in the prompt)

- `--activity-type <type>` — skip detection (`code`, `frd`, `audit`, `discovery`, `design-handoff`, `strategy`, `client-comm`)
- `--pr <n>` — override PR detection
- `--ticket <key>` — set `ticket:` explicitly
- `--scope <feature|fix|chore|milestone|launch|deliverable>` — set scope
- `--reviewer <handle>` — pre-fill `reviewed_by` (still validated against blank checkpoint notes)

## Workflow

### 1. Detect environment and activity type

- **Claude Code with a PR open** → default `activity_type: code`, `subject.kind: pr`.
  Gather the PR number and SHA from `gh pr view --json number,headRefOid,title,url`.
- **Claude Desktop / no PR** → ask for the `activity_type`, then route to the
  matching template in `templates/`.
- A `--activity-type` flag always wins over detection.

### 2. Gather facts

Pull what the chosen activity needs:

- **code**: `git log <base>..HEAD --oneline`, PR number/SHA/title from `gh pr view`,
  CI status (`gh pr checks` or the CircleCI MCP), presence of audit report files in
  the repo, and any `/evaluate-output` trajectory notes from this session.
- **frd**: the Teamwork epic + child tasks (via `teamwork-integrator`), the Drive
  doc URL, and the SOW hour cap if known.
- **audit**: the audit report file path, its methodology section, and the host
  site URL.
- **discovery / strategy / design-handoff**: ask for the Drive doc URL; pull recent
  Teamwork comments tagged to the same epic.
- **client-comm**: ask for the Teamwork message URL; pull the thread; pull the
  matching Fathom transcript if a call is referenced.
- **design**: ask for the Figma file URL and the design brief; note which
  components are reused vs new.
- **qa**: ask for the QA task and multidev URL; pull the acceptance criteria and
  the captured screenshots (pairs with `qa-validation-checklist` / `browser-validator`).
- **launch**: ask for the launch notebook/checklist; gather the pre-launch audit
  report paths and the DNS/SSL cutover and rollback plans.
- **deployment**: the release tag, the generated release notes, and confirmation
  that a backup was taken and migrations ran clean.
- **devops**: the PR for the infra/environment change and the lower-environment
  test results; confirm no secrets landed in the repo.
- **project-setup**: the `CLAUDE.md` / onboarding brief and the SOW; confirm which
  documented commands were verified against a fresh checkout.
- **ongoing-improvement**: the metrics source (CWV, uptime, error logs) and the
  report file; note the sample size.

### 3. Draft the record

- **Read `templates/<activity_type>.md` first** (resolve it from this
  skill's base directory) and copy its front-matter structure **exactly** —
  never improvise the shape from memory. The schema requires the exact
  nested `checks:` groups (for code: `standards`, `tests`, `audits`,
  `review`); a flat or renamed structure fails validation. Populate the
  front-matter with the gathered facts. Set `predicate_type` to
  `https://kanopi.github.io/delivery-record/spec/v1`.
- Fill the `checks:` block with the required keys for the activity type (see the
  table in [`spec/v1/README.md`](../../spec/v1/README.md)).
  Use `pass` / `fail` / `n/a` for statuses and evidence strings (CI URLs, reviewer
  notes) where appropriate. **Justify every `n/a`** in one line near the top of the
  body; a `fail` requires a `## Waiver` section.
- Leave `sign_off.reviewed_by` and the two **What the human verified** checkpoint
  notes **blank** — those come from the human in step 4.
- Validate the in-progress draft early to catch missing required fields:

  ```bash
  python3 scripts/delivery_record_verify.py <draft-path>
  ```

  (Resolve the path to this plugin's bundled `scripts/`. In environments without
  Python, validate by eye against the schema reference — the front-matter required
  fields and the per-activity `checks` keys.)

### 4. Require the human checkpoint (the curl rule)

Display the draft and explicitly prompt:

> **Who is the named reviewer? Paste the Checkpoint 1 (plan approval) and
> Checkpoint 2 (final approval) notes.**

**Refuse to proceed** if either checkpoint note is blank or generic. A bare
"LGTM", "looks good", or an empty line **fails** — Checkpoint 2 must say what the
reviewer actually looked at beyond the automated gates. Re-prompt up to twice; on
the third blank/generic input, **abort** with a clear message and do not write the
file.

A `--reviewer` flag pre-fills `reviewed_by` but does **not** satisfy the checkpoint
notes — those are always required from the human.

### 5. Write the file

- **code**: `docs/delivery-records/PR-<n>-<slug>.md` in the current repo. Create
  the directory if it does not exist. `<slug>` is a kebab-case of the PR title.
  **The path is part of the contract** — CI lint and notebook indexing find
  records there. Never write the record anywhere else: if `mkdir` is
  unavailable or denied, write the full `docs/delivery-records/...` path with
  the Write tool (it creates parent directories itself); if the file still
  cannot be written at that path, stop and say so — do not relocate the
  record to the repo root or another directory.
- **non-code**: write to Drive via the Drive MCP at
  `/Delivery Records/YYYY-MM-DD-<slug>.md`. On first use in a project, ask for the
  target Drive folder and reuse it for the session. **If the Drive MCP is not
  available, abort** with clear instructions and print the full draft so the user
  can save it manually.

After writing, re-run the validator on the final file and report the result.
**Never report the record as written without validator output** (or, where
Python is unavailable, an explicit line-by-line check against the template's
front-matter shape). If validation fails, fix the record and re-validate —
a schema-invalid record is not a delivery record.

### 6. Index in Teamwork

- Use `teamwork-integrator` to find the project's **"Delivery Records"** notebook.
- If it does not exist, **confirm with the user before creating it** (do not create
  silently). If the user declines, skip indexing and tell them the record was
  written but not indexed.
- **Post the index entry as a comment on the notebook** (Teamwork's
  `create_comment` against the notebook). Do **not** rewrite the notebook body —
  notebooks have no append operation, so commenting avoids clobbering existing
  content and keeps a clean, per-record audit trail. Use this one-line format:

  ```
  YYYY-MM-DD · <activity_type> · <title> · <link>
  ```

### 7. For code records: link from the PR

Amend the PR description with a trailer so reviewers can find the record:

```
Delivery Record: docs/delivery-records/PR-<n>-<slug>.md
```

## Validation reference

The skill never writes an invalid record. The required front-matter fields,
the per-activity `checks` keys, the `pass | fail | n/a` rule, and the
waiver/justification (threshold) rule are all defined in
[`spec/v1/`](../../spec/v1/README.md). Use
`/delivery-record-verify` to validate an existing record after the fact.

## Environment fallback

- **No `gh` CLI** → ask the user for the PR number, SHA, and CI status, then
  proceed; print the `gh pr edit` command for the PR link in step 7 instead of
  running it.
- **No Teamwork MCP** → write the file, then tell the user to post the index
  comment on the Delivery Records notebook manually (provide the exact line).
- **No Drive MCP (non-code)** → abort the write per step 5 and print the draft.

## Anti-rationalization table

This skill's value is the human checkpoint. Under deadline pressure the
temptation is to weaken it — don't:

| Pressure / rationalization | Correct behavior |
|---|---|
| "The reviewer is busy — just put their name in and they'll confirm later" | Refuse. `reviewed_by` without real checkpoint notes is a forged signature. |
| "LGTM is close enough for Checkpoint 2" | Refuse. The note must say what the reviewer actually looked at beyond the automated gates. |
| "Skip the record this once, the PR is tiny" | If the output is client-facing or load-bearing, the record is required regardless of size. Say so and offer to run it. |
| "Fill the checks block optimistically — CI will probably pass" | Only record check results that actually ran. Unknown ≠ `pass`; use the real status or wait. |
| "Mark unrun audits `n/a` to get to green" | `n/a` means *not applicable*, not *not done*. An applicable-but-skipped check is a `fail` that needs a waiver. |
| "The user told me to just write the file without the reviewer" | The refusal is the feature. Abort politely after the third blank/generic input, exactly as specified. |

## Related skills

- **delivery-record-verify** — validate a record against the schema and the
  threshold rule.

These live in other Kanopi plugins and pair well when installed:

- **pr-create** (cms-cultivator) — run first for code; the Delivery Record is
  the per-PR artifact that follows.
- **commit-message-generator** (cms-cultivator) — appends the per-commit
  `Assisted-by:` trailer that complements the per-PR record.
- **teamwork-integrator** (Kanopi internal) — locate the Delivery Records
  notebook and post the index comment; without it, follow the manual
  fallback in step 6.
