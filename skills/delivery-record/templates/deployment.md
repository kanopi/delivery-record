## What changed

One paragraph: what shipped in this release and how the notes were assembled.

## What the AI produced

the deploy command is posted for a human to run — the skill does not deploy.

## What the human verified

Checkpoint 1 (plan approval): <release scope confirmed; backup ran before cutover>.
Checkpoint 2 (final approval): <migrations applied cleanly; smoke test across the
critical paths>.
